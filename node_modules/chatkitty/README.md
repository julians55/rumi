ChatKitty is the first complete chat platform; bringing together everything that's 
required to build real-time chat into Web and mobile apps. Getting started with ChatKitty 
is easy and you get:

#### Reliability
Your user chat sessions remain stable even in the presence of proxies, load balancers and personal 
firewalls. ChatKitty provides auto reconnection support and offline notifications so your users stay 
in the loop.

#### Low Latency 
With response times below 100ms, ChatKitty makes sure your users have a smooth and immersive chat 
experience.

#### Cross-platform support
You can use ChatKitty across every major browser and device platform. ChatKitty also works great 
with multi-platform frameworks like React-Native and Ionic.

#### Simple and convenient API

Sample code:

```js
const kitty = ChatKittyImpl.getInstance(CHATKITTY_API_KEY);

useEffect(() => {
    // start real-time chat session
    let result = kitty.startChatSession({
        channel: channel,
        onReceivedMessage: (message) => {
            showMessage(message); // update your UI as new chat events occur
        },
    });

    return result.session.end;
}, []);
```

We've spent a lot of time thinking of the right abstractions and implementing our API to be straightforward 
and easy to use - making you more productive.

## Installation
### Install with NPM
```bash
npm install chatkitty
```

### Install with Yarn
```bash
yarn add chatkitty
```

## How to use
### Getting an API key 
You'll need [a free ChatKitty account](https://dashboard.chatkitty.com/authorization/register) before you can 
begin building chat with ChatKitty. After creating your account, create a ChatKitty application using the dashboard 
and copy its API key from your application's setting page.

### Initialize the SDK with your API key
With your API key you can initialize a new instance of the [ChatKitty JS client](https://chatkitty.github.io/chatkitty-js/classes/default.html):

```js
const kitty = ChatKittyImpl.getInstance(CHATKITTY_API_KEY);
```

### Starting a user session
To make calls to ChatKitty as a user, a user session must be started.

You can start a user session using the unique username of a user and optional authentication 
parameters to secure the user session.

```js
await kitty.startSession({
  username: email,
});
```

### Starting a chat session
Before a user can begin sending and receiving real-time messages and use in-app chat features like 
typing indicators, delivery and read receipts, emoji and like reactions, etc, you'll need to start a chat session.

```js
kitty.startChatSession({
  channel: channel,
  onReceivedMessage: (message) => {
    // handle received messages
  },
  onReceivedKeystrokes: (keystrokes) => {
    // handle received typing keystrokes
  },
  onTypingStarted: (user) => {
    // handle user starts typing
  },
  onTypingStopped: (user) => {
    // handle user stops typing
  },
  onParticipantEnteredChat: (user) => {
    // handle user who just entered the chat
  },
  onParticipantLeftChat: (user) => {
    // handle user who just left the chat
  },
  onParticipantPresenceChanged: (user) => {
    // handle user who became online, offline, do not distrub, invisible
  },
});
```

All handler methods are optional, so you only needed to register handlers for chat events your application cares about.
